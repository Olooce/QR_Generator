# QR Code Generator

This project is a custom implementation of a QR code generator in C++, supporting up to version 40 QR codes. The goal is to understand the structure and encoding process of QR codes.

## Inspiration

I got the inspiration for this project from [this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/w5ebcowAJD8?si=LtSrUG-KsjwM-D8R).

I am trying to recreate the logic behind QR codes and how they represent data.

## Building the Project

1. Make sure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a C++ compiler installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the following commands:

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Running
